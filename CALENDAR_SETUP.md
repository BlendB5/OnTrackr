## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Configuration
Ensure your PostgreSQL database is running and the connection string in `backend/.env` is correct:
```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:Admin1@localhost:5433/ontrackr?schema=public"
```

### 2. Backend Dependencies
The following packages have been installed:
- `express-validator` - Input validation
- `@types/express-validator` - TypeScript types

### 3. Frontend Dependencies
No additional frontend dependencies required - uses existing UI components.

### 4. Browser Notifications
The reminder system uses browser notifications. Users will be prompted to allow notifications when first accessing the calendar.

## Usage

### Creating Events
1. Navigate to Calendar page
2. Click "Add Event" button
3. Fill in title, description, and date/time
4. Event appears on calendar views

### Managing Tasks
1. Click "Add Task" button
2. Enter task title and due date
3. Optionally set reminder time
4. Tasks appear on calendar and can be toggled complete

### Setting Reminders
- Reminders can be set when creating tasks
- Browser notifications appear at scheduled times
- Visual notification panel shows upcoming reminders

## Optional: FullCalendar Integration

For more advanced calendar features, you can install FullCalendar:

```bash
npm install @fullcalendar/react @fullcalendar/daygrid @fullcalendar/timegrid @fullcalendar/interaction
```

This would provide:
- Drag-and-drop event creation
- More calendar view options
- Advanced event editing
- Better mobile responsiveness

## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues
- Verify PostgreSQL is running on correct port (5433)
- Check database credentials in `backend/.env`
- Ensure `ontrackr` database exists

### API Errors
- Check backend server is running on port 5000
- Verify authentication tokens are valid
- Check browser console for detailed error messages

### Notification Issues
- Ensure browser notifications are enabled
- Check if user has granted notification permission
- Verify reminder times are in the future

## Next Steps

The calendar module is now fully functional with:
- ‚úÖ Database schema and migrations
- ‚úÖ Backend API routes with validation
- ‚úÖ Frontend calendar interface
- ‚úÖ Task management system
- ‚úÖ Reminder notifications
- ‚úÖ Responsive design

The system is ready for production use and can be extended with additional features as needed.
